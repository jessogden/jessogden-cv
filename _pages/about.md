I am an anthropologist, STS and critical informatics scholar of digital cultures, labour and the everyday politics embedded in the construction of data and information. My PhD took an ethnographic approach to understanding organisational and community-based efforts to archive the Web -- in web archives -- through the investigation of three case studies through the lens of infrastructure, culture and politics. 

I have an MSc in Web Science (Electronics and Computer Science) and an MSc in Archaeological Computing (Archaeology) from the University of Southampton in Southampton, UK and a BA in Anthropology from Centre College, Kentucky, USA. My PhD in Web Science (expected 2019) is based in the Department of Sociology, Social Policy and Criminology and the Web Science Centre of Doctoral Training at the University of Southampton.
