I am a social scientist and critical informatics scholar of digital culture, data politics and the Web. My research centres around the everyday power and politics embedded in the construction of the Web's past. My research experience cross-cuts several domains and subject areas related to the ways in which digital culture, media and knowledge are constructed and represented online, as well as the broad implications these have for contemporary and future digital scholarship.

I recently submitted my PhD in Web Science - based in the Department of Sociology, Social Policy and Criminology and the Web Science Centre of Doctoral Training at the University of Southampton. I also have a MSc in Web Science and a MSc in Archaeological Computing from the University of Southampton, UK and a BA in Anthropology from Centre College, Kentucky, USA.
