<h4>Abstract</h4>

A public engagement project at the <a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/past-festivals/web-we-want">Web We Want Festival</a> in London, 2014. The project was designed by several Web Science Doctoral Training Centre graduate students to engage both festival go-ers and members of the public on issues of data privacy and the digital economy. The project approached both festival go-ers and Twitter users through a simple online survey designed to gauge public perceptions about the types of data that are shared through online services. The results of the survey were displayed in real-time at the Festival and offered a comparison between the responses of festival go-ers and the Twitter users.

<h4>Participant Information</h4>

<strong>What’s this all about?</strong>  Our aim is to get the public thinking about what information they choose to provide and link to themselves online. The project is supported by the University of Southampton and forms part of the #WebWeWant Festival. 

<strong>Why me?</strong> You have been chosen because you are a member of the public over the age of 18. 

<strong>What happens if I get involved?</strong>
<ol>
<li>You will be asked a series of questions about who you would be willing to share your personal data with.</li>
<li>Your (anonymous) answers to these questions will be recorded, aggregated and displayed ‘live’ at the Web Science market stall at the #WebWeWant Festival, and may be used at a later date for research purposes.</li>
<li>You will not be asked to provide any personal data at any stage.</li>
<li>Following the survey, one follow-up question will be asked about who you trust the most with your personal data. Your  answer to this will be photographed and Tweeted publically online.</li>
</ol>
