I had my viva the week before last - examined by Niels Brugger (external) and Nick Gibbins (internal). I've walked away with minor corrections and couldn't be more stoked. I managed to take a couple of days off before back to the application grind. In all the excitement I completely forgot to document the day, but in case you missed it, I tweeted a post-viva bliss selfie with my dog Rosie!
