I had my viva the week before last - examined by <a href="http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/null(2814967c-56b1-4b7c-9599-50ff791909b7).html">Niels Br√ºgger</a> (external examiner) and <a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/nmg">Nick Gibbins</a> (internal examiner). I've walked away with minor corrections and couldn't be more stoked. In all the excitement I completely forgot to document the day, but in case you missed it, I tweeted a post-viva bliss selfie with my dog Rosie!
